ROM Based Temperature Conversion

This lab introduces the concept of memory and demonstrates how to create lookup tables stored within a BRAM module. The project focuses on temperature conversion between Fahrenheit and Celsius. Our design uses two lookup tables, with pre-stored conversion data in memory files. By utilizing these tables, the design efficiently minimizes hardware resources, avoiding the need for real-time arithmetic operations and complex calculations. This streamlined approach is ideal for simple applications such as digital thermometers.

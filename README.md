# FPGA Projects

This repository contains a collection of Verilog-based FPGA projects developed for learning, experimentation, and demonstration of digital logic design principles. Each project is organized in its own folder and includes source code, testbenches, and documentation where applicable.

## üìÇ Projects Included

- [Barrel Shifter](./Barrel-Shifter)  
  A Verilog module implementing a logical barrel shifter capable of shifting data left or right by a configurable amount.

- [Square Wave Generator](./Square-Wave-Generator)  
  Generates a periodic square wave signal with a fixed frequency and duty cycle, useful for clock or timing applications.

- [Early Debouncer](./Early-Debouncer)  
  Implements a digital debouncing mechanism to clean up noisy mechanical switch inputs.

- [ROM-Based Temperature Conversion](./Rom-Based-Tempreture-Conversion)  
  Uses a ROM lookup table to convert digital sensor data into temperature values.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- Verilog HDL
- Vivado (Xilinx)

Asymmetric Fifo Buffer:

This lab revolved around the design and analysis of an asymmetric Fifo buffer (first in, first out). This means the buffer's number of bits at the input differ from the bits at the output. Specifically, this Fifo buffer has a 16-bit input with an 8-bit output. With this configuartion, the buffer will write 16-bit data and reads 8-bit data per read cycle. This allows for larger data to be read efficiently in smaller portions.
